# üîÅ DC Motor Control with TIP120 and Button

This Arduino project demonstrates how to power and control a **DC motor** using a **TIP120 transistor**, a **push button**, and a **9V battery**. The project highlights how to safely control higher-power components with a microcontroller and introduces basic principles of transistor-based switching.

## üìù Description

The **DC Motor** project was created to explore how a DC motor can be powered and controlled using simple electronics and Arduino. By using a **TIP120 transistor**, we safely control the motor with a small signal from the Arduino.

The project also includes:
- A **push button** to manually toggle the motor
- A **diode** to protect against back EMF
- A **9V battery** as a separate power source for the motor

This setup reflects how real-world circuits isolate control logic from power-hungry components, which is essential in robotics and automation.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Wiring the Circuit

- **DC Motor**:
  - One lead to 9V battery (+)
  - One lead to TIP120 collector
- **TIP120 Transistor**:
  - Collector ‚Üí DC Motor
  - Emitter ‚Üí GND
  - Base ‚Üí Digital Pin 9 (through 1kŒ© resistor recommended)
- **Flyback Diode**:
  - Across motor terminals
  - Cathode to +, Anode to -
- **Push Button**:
  - One side to Digital Pin 2
  - Other side to GND (with a 10kŒ© pull-down resistor)

### 2. Upload the Code

- Open Arduino IDE
- Write or paste the motor control sketch
- Connect your Arduino Uno via USB
- Select correct board and port under **Tools**
- Click **Upload**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The **Arduino** monitors the **push button** connected to Digital Pin 2.
2. When the button is pressed:
   - Arduino sends a HIGH signal to the base of the **TIP120**
   - The transistor switches ON and allows current to flow from the **9V battery to the DC motor**
   - The motor spins
3. When the button is released:
   - The transistor turns OFF
   - The motor stops
4. The **diode** protects the circuit from voltage spikes generated by the motor when it stops (back EMF).

This setup safely handles higher-current loads without damaging the Arduino.
